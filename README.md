<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

    This project is to mainly focus on getting use to next, react, sass and javascript after a bit of a break.

Rack Tracker is a idea I've had in my head for awhile I am just now attempting build it, and get some of my co-workers to use it while giving me some helpfull feed back.
This web app my be split into multiple app's later in the future. The main goal is to track and give accurate wait times and rack
down time info.

Here's why:

- To get a better understanding of next.js.
- Getting use to using scss/sass with next.js
- Creating a tool that will help me and other drivers do their job's in a more timely manner.
